          I'm Chris Fahey — a software engineer with 5+ years of industry experience, and the photographer behind
          <strong> LiveNapalm</strong>.

        <p className="mb-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          After a company layoff, I turned to my passion for music and photography, documenting the raw energy of the Pacific Northwest’s metal scene. LiveNapalm is more than a photo archive — it’s a personal project that merges my love for live music with my software skills.

          This site is built from the ground up using modern web tech to showcase high-resolution photography in a way that’s searchable, filterable, and fast. I’m building it in public to demonstrate my skills and continue growing as an engineer.
